## CoderDojoKata skin

The css is generated with [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/).

For easy development [Koala](http://koala-app.com/) app was used: the koala-config.json that defines the path mappings for css and js output is committed on git. In Koala create a project selecting the coderdojokata skin folder: it will detect the config file.

SCSS source files are located in the src/css folder under the coderdojokata skin folder, and the output is produced in the resources folder.
