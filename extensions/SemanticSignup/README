SemanticSignup version 0.4.

This is a MediaWiki extension built on top of the Semantic MediaWiki
and Semantic Forms extensions and intended to be used with them.

It is recommended to read those extensions' manuals before this one.

==License==

This extension is open-source software, available under the GNU GPLv3+.

==Usage==

This extension tweaks user registration process in order to make 
users populate their user pages with semantic data at registration time.
Whenever the user registration form is requested the user is redirected
to the Semantic Signup special page where he has to enter the usual
account data and some additional information into a semantic form.
When the form is submitted, the usual account information is used 
to register the new user account and a new User:<Username> page is 
populated with the additional data.
