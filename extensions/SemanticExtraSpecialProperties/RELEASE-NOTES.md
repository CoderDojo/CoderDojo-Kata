### 1.0.0

Released on 2014-02-23.

1.0 is a complete rewrite of the existing implementation to allow sufficient test integration which made it necessary
to split the original file into different classes (force encapsulation), eliminate GLOBALS (where necessary inject
configuration via the constructor), and enable service injection (increase inversion of control).

`Exif` and `ShorUrl` handling has been moved into separate classes, property registration has been uncoupled from the
functional implementation. Property definitions no longer reside within PHP and have been moved into `json` file for
easier access and configurability.

Due to those internal changes and the introduced test integration, 1.0 requires Semantic MediaWiki 1.9. It is strongly
recommended to run `update.php` together with a `SMW_refreshData.php`.

For details about the rewrite, its discussion, and changes see #10.
