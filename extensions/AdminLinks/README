== Overview ==

Admin Links is an extension to MediaWiki that provides a new special page
meant to hold links that are useful to an administrator; it attempts to
function as a "control panel" for the actions that a wiki administrator
typically has to perform. Any user can access this page, but for
administrators a new link to this page is placed within their "personal
URLs" (between "Talk" and "Preferences").

Admin Links provides an API that other extensions can call in order to
add their own sections and links to the page; links can be to both special
pages and outside documentation URLs, among others.
