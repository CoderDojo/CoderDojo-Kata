== Requirements ==

The extension can make use of, but does not require, an install of
Semantic MediaWiki. If Semantic MediaWiki is used, it must be of
version 1.5 or greater. For more details, see Semantic MediaWiki's
own installation requirements.

== Installation ==

(1) Extract the archive to obtain the directory "DataTransfer"
    that contains all relevant files. Copy this directory (or
    extract/download it) to "[wikipath]/extensions/".
(2) Insert the following line into the file "[wikipath]/LocalSettings.php":
      include_once( "$IP/extensions/DataTransfer/DataTransfer.php" );
(3) To enable importing spreadsheet files (Excel, OOCalc, Gnumeric, ...)
    use Composer to install the phpoffice/phpexcel module. From the MediaWiki
    installation directory call
      composer require "phpoffice/phpexcel:~1.8"
